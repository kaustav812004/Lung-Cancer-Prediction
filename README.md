# Introduction
Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer worldwide, necessitating advanced and accurate diagnostic tools to improve patient outcomes. The major factors that contribute to it are smoking, drinking, shortness of breath and many more. This study conducts a comprehensive performance analysis of various machine learning classifiers for the prediction of lung cancer. The classifiers evaluated include Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks. Utilizing a publicly available dataset, we preprocess the data to address imbalances and missing values, ensuring robustness in our analysis. The classifiers are assessed based on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Our results indicate that ensemble methods, particularly Random Forests, exhibit superior predictive accuracy and reliability compared to other models. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of feature selection and hyperparameter tuning in enhancing model performance. This research underscores the potential of machine learning classifiers in lung cancer prediction, providing a foundation for future work aimed at integrating these models into clinical practice for early detection and personalized treatment planning.
The implementation of this research utilizes Python programming language along with popular libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow for machine learning and natural language processing tasks.
# Evaluation Parameters
Accuracy : Ratio of accurately predicted predication of learning model model is called accuracy. Accuracy answers the question “Out of all the predictions we made, how many were true?”
Precision : This ratio gives the value of true positive among all positive prediction. It answers the question “Out of all the positive predictions we made, how many were true?”
Recall : Same as True Positive Rate (TPR) that shows the ratio of true positive in total positive. It answers the question “Out of all the data points that should be predicted as true, how many did we correctly predict as true?”
F1 Score : F1 Score is a measure that combines recall and precision. Harmonic mean of precision and recall which performs well in imbalanced dataset.
# Conclusion
The research on lung cancer prediction based on their symptoms by using machine classifier is provided in this paper. This model takes the symptom of patients and predict disease by giving output 0 as less chance and 1 as more chance of lung cancer. Firstly, we have evaluated different constant of performance metrices and compared them. The outcome shows that Random Forest predicts output with higher accuracy, recall and F1 score as compared to other machine language techniques. Secondly, we experimented in SVM code by changing the kernels, As the dataset we used is straight-line data with less cases, linear kernel performed with higher accuracy and recall, The problems like non-linear nature, complex patterns and use of curve figure, then other kernels can be used for more accurate prediction. At last phase, we investigated by improvement of k value and noted their accurate predicting percentage which are beneficial for preventing underfitting and overfitting. 
The proposed work can be re-introduced and enhanced for automation of disease prediction. Real data from health care organizations can be collected, available algorithms can be compared for robustness and generalizability of result.
